# Real Time Bus Tracker
 
## Project Description

The Real Time Bus Tracker allows the user to view MBTA bus data to determine stops between Harvard and MIT.


An animated marker shows the stops on the map and highlights the bus route for the user to plan their transportation needed accordingly.


Future work may include adding in real-time traffic data to show any delays in bus schedules.
